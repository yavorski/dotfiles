This is a modified version of
https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized for neovim. It supports the
true color (24-bit color) mode that neovim provides. The simplest configuration
is the following.

    let $NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR=1
    set background=dark " or light
    colorscheme solarized
